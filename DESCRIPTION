Description: Efficiently estimate the average treatment effect by gaining 
    efficiency from secondary endpoints. Two joint models are fit for the 
    primary and secondary endpoints. One is saturated while the other uses
    structural equation modeling constaints to gain efficiency. Model averaging
    protects against bias from structural equation modeling under 
    misspecification.
